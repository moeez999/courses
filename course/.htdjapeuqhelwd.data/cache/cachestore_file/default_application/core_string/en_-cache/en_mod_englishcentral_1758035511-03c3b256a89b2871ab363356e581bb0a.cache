To set up the activity, the teacher first defines the following study goals:

* the number of videos to Watch
* the number of words to Learn
* the number of lines to Speak

The teacher then searches the EnglishCentral video library and selects which videos should be added to this EnglishCentral activity.

Finally, the students choose one or more of the videos they would like to watch. After watching a video, they can choose which words from the video they would like to learn, and which lines they wish to practice speaking.

As each student studies, the dials on their scoreboard are updated to give feedback about their progress towards the Watch, Learn and Speak
