Cloud Poodll Assignment Submission
========================================


This is an audio and video recording submission plugin for the Moodle assignment. It requires an API username and secret associated with a subscription from https://poodll.com

1. Download

Download the plugin from: https://github.com/justinhunt/moodle-assignsubmission_cloudpoodll


2 Unzip / Rename / Upload
============
Expand (unzip) the zip file.

Rename the main folder to "cloudpoodll." It should contain all the files like "version.php."

Upload the "cloudpoodll" folder into the folder

[PATH TO MOODLE]/mod/assign/submission


3. Get Moodle to Install It
============
Visit Settings > Site Administration > Notifications, and let Moodle guide you through the install.

Moodle should show you the plugin settings after installation. The defaults should be ok for most users. But you will need your Poodll API username and secret from your members area on Poodll.com.

5. A few notes
============
Cloud Poodll connects to https://cloud.poodll.com and https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com and so will not work without access to the internet.

Thats all.
