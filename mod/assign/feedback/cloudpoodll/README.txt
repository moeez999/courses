Cloud Poodll Feedback for Moodle Assignment
========================================

Use Cloud Poodll feedback to respond to  assignment submissions with video and audio recordings.

If installing by zip file there should be only one folder expanded after you unzip the zip file.
If it is not called "cloudpoodll" rename it to that.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/mod/assign/feedback folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page(under site administration). 
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL feedback type for the Moodle assignment.

The default admin settings will be fine in most cases, but you will need to add your Cloud Poodll API user and secret.
You can get these from Poodll.com.

When you go to create an assignment you should see an option to enable Cloud Poodll feedback in the settings page.
