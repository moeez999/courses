PoodLL Feedback for Moodle Assignment
========================================
Thanks for downloading the PoodLL Feedback type. 
Using this you to respond via video and audio recordings, and pictures to  assignment submissions.

There should be only one folder "poodll" expanded after you unzip the zip file.
Place this folder into your moodle installation under the [site_root]/mod/assign/feedback folder.

Then login to your site as admin and go to your Moodle site's "notifications" page(under site administration). 
Moodle should then guide you through the installation or upgrade of the PoodLL feedback type for the Moodle 2.3+ assignment. 

When you go to create an assignment you should see an option to enable PoodLL feedback in the settings page. 
Beneath that you will see a choice of PoodLL recorders to use in the submission.
1) MP3 Recording (doesn't require Red5)
2) Video recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
3) Audio Recording (via PoodLL's Red Server tokyo.poodll.com)
4) Whiteboard (draw pictures)

Moodle caching can affect audio/video playback reliability. To turn off text filter caching:  
Go to: Site Administration -> Plugins -> Filters ->Common Filter Settings
There set "Text Cache Lifetime" to "no"

*Please be aware that the PoodLL feedback type relies on the PoodLL Filter being installed, and won't work properly otherwise*

Good luck.
